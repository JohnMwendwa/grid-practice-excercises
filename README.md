# Grid Practice excercises

I created this repo with the intent of practicing how much of the CSS grid I have mastered in order to create layouts, and style components using grid.

Halfway I thought why not allow other developers to showcase their mastery too.

## How To Contribute

1. Fork the repo
2. Create a new folder in the root directory and add your grid project files there.
3. After you've finished your project, add the link to your project file in the root index.html file using the following format.

```html
...

<li class="nav__item">
  <a href="/equal-height-cards/index.html" class="nav__link">
    Create cards with equal heights
  </a>
</li>

...
```

4. You can append your name to the end of the link so others can know you created the project or search for you e.g

```html
<li class="nav__item">
  <a href="/equal-height-cards/index.html" class="nav__link">
    Create cards with equal heights - John Mwendwa
  </a>
</li>
```

5. Try to use only grid for your layouts and design to see how uch you've mustered it.

6. If you also want to showcase your CSS flexbox mastery, checkout my other repo on flexbox and be sure to contribute.

## Word to designers !

If you have an extremely good eye for design, you can alter the root style.css stylesheet. Although all your alterations are not always guaranteed to be added and merged but it's always worth the effort.
